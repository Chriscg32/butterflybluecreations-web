# ðŸš€ Deployment Options - ButterflyBlue Creations

## Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Web Interface (Recommended)

Since there's an account issue with the CLI, let's use the web interface:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/new
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Import Your Repository**
   - Click "Import Git Repository"
   - Select: `Chriscg32/butterflybluecreations-web`
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure Build Settings** (Should auto-detect from vercel.json)
   - Framework Preset: `Create React App`
   - Build Command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `frontend/build`
   - Install Command: `cd frontend && npm install`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the build

## Option 2: Deploy to Netlify (Free Alternative)

If you prefer a completely free option:

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/start
   - Sign in with GitHub

2. **Import Repository**
   - Select: `Chriscg32/butterflybluecreations-web`
   - Configure build settings:
     ```
     Base directory: frontend
     Build command: npm run build
     Publish directory: frontend/build
     ```

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add your Supabase credentials

## Option 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Free Static Hosting)

For a simple static deployment:

1. **Install gh-pages**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. **Update package.json**
   Add to scripts:
   ```json
   "predeploy": "npm run build",
   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Option 4: Fix Vercel Account

To continue with Vercel:
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/teams/chris-gates-projects/settings/billing
2. Add a payment method (they have a generous free tier)
3. Return to the CLI deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps

1. **For now**: Use Option 2 (Netlify) - it's completely free
2. **Later**: Fix your Vercel account if you prefer their platform
3. **Remember**: Add your Supabase environment variables after deployment

## Environment Variables Needed

Regardless of platform, add these:
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```
